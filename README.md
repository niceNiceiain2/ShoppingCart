# ShoppingCart

This project is part of my CS 3773 Software Engineering course. 
It was developed as part of the RowdyMarketplace website application project. 

In this project, I implemented the shopping cart functionality, which allows users 
to select items, view their prices, and proceed to checkout. I worked alongside my 
teammate who built the backend using Spring Boot. My role involved integrating my code 
into his backend to ensure smooth communication between the shopping cart features and 
the overall application.

# Project Description

The shopping cart allows users to:
- Add items to their cart
- View the price for each item
- Calculate the total price
- Proceed to checkout when ready

- Item Selection: Users can select items to add to their cart.
- Price Calculation: The code calculates the total price based on the items added.
- Checkout Process: Users can review their items in cart and proceed with the checkout process.

Programming Languages used:
- Java: Used for implementing the shopping cart functionality.
- Spring Boot: My teammate used Spring Boot to develop the backend, and I helped integrate the shopping cart functionality with it.
